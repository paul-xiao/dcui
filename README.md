> tailwindcss plugin forked from daisyUI


## keywords

- styled
Boolean (default: true)

If it's true, components will have colors and style so you won't need to design anything. If it's false, components will have no color and no visual style so you can design your own style on a basic skeleton.

- rtl
Boolean (default: false)

If it's true, your theme will be right-to-left. You need to add dir='rtl' to your body tag. If you're using daisyUI with RTL option, I suggest using tailwindcss-flip plugin to flip all your Tailwind utilities automatically.
